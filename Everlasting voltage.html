                <h1>Types of Electric Vehicles: BEV, PHEV and HEV</h1>
                <p>There are three main types of electric vehicles (EVs), classed by the degree that electricity is used as their energy source. BEVs, or battery electric vehicles, PHEVs of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, and HEVs, or hybrid electric vehicles. Only BEVs are capable of charging on a level 3, DC fast charge.</p>
                <h4>Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV)</h4>
                <p>Battery Electric Vehicles, also called BEVs, and more frequently called EVs, are fully-electric vehicles with rechargeable batteries and no gasoline engine. Battery electric vehicles store electricity onboard with high-capacity battery packs. Their battery power is used to run the electric motor and all onboard electronics. BEVs do not emit any harmful emissions and hazards caused by traditional gasoline-powered vehicles. BEVs are charged by electricity from an external source. Electric Vehicle (EV) chargers are classified according to the speed with which they recharge an EVs battery.</p>
                <p>The classifications are Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 or DC fast charging. Level 1 EV charging uses a standard household (120v) outlet to plug into the electric vehicle and takes over 8 hours to charge an EV for approximately 75-80 miles. Level one charging is typically done at home or at your workplace. Level 1 chargers have the capability to charge most EVs on the market.</p><p>Level 2 charging requires a specialized station which provides power at 240v. Level 2 chargers are typically found at workplaces and public charging stations and will take about 4 hours to charge a battery to 75-80 miles of range.</p>
                <p>Level 3 charging, DC fast charging, or simply fast charging is currently the fastest charging solution in the EV market. DC fast chargers are found at dedicated EV charging stations and charge a battery up to 90 miles range in approximately 30 minutes.</p><p><strong>BEV</strong> Examples that can charge on DC Level 3 Fast Chargers</p>

                <h4><strong>Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV)</strong></h4>
                <p>Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles or PHEVs can recharge the battery through both regenerative braking and “plugging in” to an external source of electrical power. While “standard” hybrids can (at low speed) go about 1-2 miles before the gasoline engine turns on, PHEV models can go anywhere from 10-40 miles before their gas engines provide assistance.</p><p><strong>PHEV</strong> Examples</p>

                    <li>Porsche Cayenne S E-Hybrid</li>
                    <li>Porsche Panamera S E-hybrid</li>
                    <li>Toyota Prius</li>
                    <li>Volvo XC90 T8</li>
                </ul>

                <h4><strong>Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEV)</strong></h4>
                <p>HEVs are powered by both gasoline and electricity. The electric energy is generated by the car’s own braking system to recharge the battery. This is called ‘regenerative braking’, a process where the electric motor helps to slow the vehicle and uses some of the energy normally converted to heat by the brakes.</p>
                <p>HEVs start off using the electric motor, then the gasoline engine cuts in as load or speed rises. The two motors are controlled by an internal computer, which ensures the best economy for the driving conditions.</p>
                <p><strong>HEV</strong> Examples</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Toyota Prius Hybrid</li>
                    <li>Honda Civic Hybrid</li>
                    <li>Toyota Camry Hybrid</li>
                </ul>
